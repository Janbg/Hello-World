Imagination is more important than knowledge.
For knowledge is limited to all we now know and understand, while imagination embraces the entire world,
and all there ever will be to know and understand.

Don't waste your life in doubts and fears: spend yourself on the work before you, well assured that the right performance of this hour's duties will be the best preparation for the hours or ages that follow it.

Even if you feel that everything is going badly, just think of it in a positive way. It is only happening because your life is getting better and you are getting stronger. It may be tough the whole week, but soon you will feel that you have good luck and that the struggle was worth it.
